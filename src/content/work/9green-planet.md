**Green Planet Landscaping** is a professionally designed website I developed for **Outmerce**. The website focuses on sustainable and eco-friendly landscaping solutions, offering a range of services aimed at promoting environmental health.

As the website developer, I contributed to:  
- **Custom Design**: Created a modern, visually appealing layout that aligns with the companyâ€™s environmentally conscious brand.  
- **Service Pages**: Developed pages that highlight Green Planetâ€™s eco-friendly landscaping services, such as water conservation, native plant installations, and sustainable garden designs.  
- **Gallery**: Added a gallery to showcase their previous work and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.  
- **Contact & Inquiry Forms**: Integrated easy-to-use forms for potential clients to inquire about services or schedule consultations.  
- **Branding**: Ensured the design communicated the companyâ€™s green initiatives and focus on environmental sustainability.

The website is responsive and optimized for all devices, ensuring a smooth user experience.
