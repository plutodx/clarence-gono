**Luxury SoCal Realty** is a real estate website I built using **Sierra Interactive**, a CRM and website builder tailored for the real estate industry, focusing on high-end properties in Southern California.  

As the website developer, I contributed to:  
- **Custom Design**: Created a sleek, sophisticated design that aligns with the luxury market, highlighting premium properties and amenities.  
- **Property Listings**: Developed detailed property pages featuring stunning images, descriptions, and essential property details to attract buyers.  
- **Advanced Search Functionality**: Integrated a powerful search tool to allow users to filter listings based on specific criteria like price, location, and amenities.  
- **Lead Capture & Contact Forms**: Designed easy-to-use forms to capture leads and facilitate contact between clients and agents.  

The website is fully responsive, ensuring visitors can browse listings seamlessly from any device.
