**JEA Landscaping** is a custom website I built for **Outmerce**. The site serves as an online showcase for JEA Landscapingâ€™s professional services, including residential and commercial landscaping design, maintenance, and enhancements.

As the website developer, I contributed to:  
- **Custom Design**: Created an aesthetically pleasing, easy-to-navigate website that highlights the companyâ€™s landscaping expertise.  
- **Service Pages**: Developed clear, concise pages that describe services such as lawn care, hardscaping, and landscape lighting.  
- **Portfolio Section**: Integrated a portfolio to showcase before-and-after images of landscaping projects, demonstrating the company's capabilities.  
- **Contact Forms**: Added simple contact forms for inquiries and quotes, streamlining communication with potential clients.  
- **Branding**: Designed the website to reflect the companyâ€™s professionalism and high-quality services.

The website is responsive, ensuring optimal viewing across all devices.
