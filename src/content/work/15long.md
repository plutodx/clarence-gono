**Long Road Side Assistance** is a website I developed for **Outmerce**. It serves as an online platform for a company offering reliable roadside assistance services, ensuring customers can access help when stranded on the road.

As the website developer, I contributed to:  
- **Custom Design**: Designed a professional, user-friendly website that makes it easy for visitors to access services.  
- **Service Pages**: Developed detailed pages explaining the types of roadside assistance offered, including towing, tire changes, and jump-starts.  
- **Emergency Contact**: Integrated a call-to-action for emergency services, making it easy for users to get in touch when they need assistance.  
- **Branding**: Created a design that communicates reliability, trust, and quick response time.  

The website is responsive, offering a seamless experience across desktop and mobile devices.
