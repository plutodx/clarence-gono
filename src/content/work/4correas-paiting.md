**Correa's Painting Services** is a showcase website I developed as part of my role at **Outmerce**. The website serves as a professional online presence for a painting service company, providing information about their services, past projects, and company values.

As the website developer, I contributed to:  
- **Custom Design**: Created a visually appealing, clean, and easy-to-navigate layout, highlighting the companyâ€™s services and expertise.  
- **Service Pages**: Developed individual pages to outline the range of painting services offered, including residential, commercial, and custom jobs.  
- **Project Showcase**: Incorporated a portfolio section to display completed projects, helping potential clients view the quality of work.  
- **Contact & Inquiry Forms**: Integrated user-friendly forms for easy customer inquiries and bookings.  
- **Branding**: Ensured the design aligned with Correaâ€™s professional image and reinforced trust with potential clients.

The website was built to be responsive and easily maintainable, allowing the company to update their information and portfolio as needed.
