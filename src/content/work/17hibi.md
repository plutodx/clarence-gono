**Hibin Ministry** is a website I developed for **Outmerce**, dedicated to providing spiritual guidance, resources, and community outreach programs. The site is designed to be a platform for those seeking spiritual support and connection.

As the website developer, I contributed to:  
- **Custom Design**: Designed a calm, inviting layout that aligns with the ministryâ€™s values of peace, support, and community.  
- **Content Pages**: Developed pages detailing the ministryâ€™s mission, services, events, and resources for spiritual growth.  
- **Community Engagement**: Added features like event registration forms and donation options to facilitate community involvement.  
- **Branding**: Ensured the websiteâ€™s design reflected the ministryâ€™s mission of support, compassion, and connection.

The website is responsive, ensuring accessibility on all devices.
